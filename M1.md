## Questions to research:
- Future of DRM
- Types of DRM
- How do people get around DRM
- Legistlation for/against DRM
- Implementations, basic DRM
- Economic impact
- Broader context

## implementation
- 40 bit content scramble system: brute force?
- breaking actual DRM would be illegal

Be sure to include high-profile cases of DRM fighting (DeCSS, etc) and uses of DRM tech for other things (it can be used for privacy management too).  Include protocols like HDCP and how TPM chips in most modern devices can enable a trusted compute environment that is hospitable to DRM.

Since this is a CSSE class, don't spend a huge amount of time on legal analysis, but a little is ok.  What kind of demo are you thinking of doing?  Try to avoid violating laws or terms of use... don't want you to get into trouble.
