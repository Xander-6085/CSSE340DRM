# CSSE340 DRM Project
Topic: Digital Rights Management Research
Summary: Digital Rights Management (DRM) is the process of protecting copyrighted works in a digital medium. DRM encompasses a set of mechanisms meant to limit what the user can do with technologies for the sake of copyright or other corporate protections. DRM is known for blocking users from copying, sharing, or accessing digital content they own, such as the restrictions on CD copying or offline textbook usage. This project aims to research the history, implementation, legality, limitations, and future of DRM.
Questions:
- What does the future of DRM look like?
- What are the types of DRM and when are they commonly used?
- How do people get around DRM?
- What legistlation is there for and against DRM? What legal troubles has DRM faced in the past?
- How can basic DRM be implementated?
- What is the economic impact of DRM?
- In what broader context does DRM subsist?

# Demo
We will attempt to implement a similar encryption scheme to the Content Scramble System and attempt to brute force its 40 bit key after demonstrating how the system works.
